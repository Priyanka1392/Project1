Power Systems:<br><br>

 An electric power system is a network of electrical components deployed to supply, transfer, store, and use electric power.
 An example of an electric power system is the grid that provides power to an extended area. An electrical grid power system can
 be broadly divided into the generators that supply the power, the transmission system that carries the power from the generating
 centres to the load centres, and the distribution system that feeds the power to nearby homes and industries. Smaller power
 systems are also found in industry, hospitals, commercial buildings and homes. The majority of these systems rely upon three-
 phase AC powerâ€”the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world. Specialised power
 systems that do not always rely upon three-phase AC power are found in aircraft, electric rail systems, ocean liners and 
 automobiles.
